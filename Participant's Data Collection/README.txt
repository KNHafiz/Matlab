The idea of the project is to develop an interactive code that will ask some demographics questions to the participants who will come for one of my future projects. 

There will be three parts of this project:
-- Pre-session questionnaires, such as: name, address, contact information (email or mobile), handedness, if the participant has movement disorder then his/her diagnosis, any allergies. 
These form will be obtain before the experiment. The participants will be given random number in this step which will be used to store all their experimental data. 
-- A video demostration during session using MATLAB Robotics Toolbox.
-- Post-session survey to know if they were comfortable using the wearable robot, and using the interactive robot; Kinova Gen3 7Dof robot.
